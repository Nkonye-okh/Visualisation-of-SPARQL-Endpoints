# Visual Exploitation of SPARQL Endpoints
In this research we compare several latest programs that enable graph visualization of SPARQL endpoints. The goal of this work is to give a small survey of tools and find the limitations. Nonetheless, the findings are relevant for both the users and the developers, who are interested in more user-friendly design and efficient approaches.

Nowadays data exploration has a crucial role and not only IT companies are interested in it. A lot of enterprises, government and educational institutions etc., where non-tech users are also engaged, use a huge amount of data every day. Therefore, there is a need for efficient and accessible visualization tools for better understanding of the data.
